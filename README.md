# pico_breathing_coach

A simple breathing app for the raspberry pico.

The app has two different modes:

A) Pico explorer base

B) Waveshare LCD 0.96

The pico explorer mode uses visual output and sound, the waveshare lcd mode currently does not support sound, yet.

To flash the code, simply save all .py files to the pico via Thonny.
Set the production switch in main.py to choose which mode to use.

Happy Breating!
